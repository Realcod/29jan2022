/*
You are given a positive integer N, and you have to find the number of ways to represent N as a sum of cubes of two integers(letâ€™s say A and B), such that:
N = A^3 + B^3.
Note:
1. A should be greater than or equal to one (A>=1).
2. B should be greater than or equal to zero (B>=0).
3. (A, B) and (B, A) should be considered different solutions, if A is not equal to B, i.e (A, B) and (B, A) will not be distinct if A=B.
